# GuardianSim Worklog

This is an append-only record of implementation and experiment activity. Keep
claims factual and link to durable evidence.

## 2026-07-24 — Repository bootstrap and Gate 1

### Local implementation

- Forked the retained AMD competition reference pipeline into GuardianSim.
- Added candidate generation, risk scoring, failure diagnosis, bounded recovery,
  a Genesis evaluator protocol, and baseline-vs-GuardianSim report export.
- Added seven unit tests covering candidate generation, state restoration,
  scoring, failure handling, recovery, and benchmark behavior.
- Added Radeon Cloud setup, verification, session, and GPU-budget scripts.

Commits:

- `2119d0d` — `feat: add Genesis evaluation and benchmark pipeline`
- `2283818` — `fix: pin Genesis-compatible NumPy image stack`

### Radeon Cloud Session A

Approximate active work window: 17:16–18:00 China Standard Time.

Environment checks:

```text
Python 3.12.3
PyTorch 2.9.1+gitff65f5b
HIP 7.2.53211-e1a6bc5663
GPU available: True
GPU: AMD Radeon Graphics
```

Installation:

```bash
uv pip install --python /opt/venv/bin/python -e .
```

Two dependency problems were discovered and resolved:

1. `scikit-image==0.22.0` was incompatible with the installed NumPy 2 ABI.
2. Upgrading without an upper bound selected NumPy 2.5.1, which Numba rejected.

The resulting project constraints are:

```text
numpy>=1.26.4,<2.3
scikit-image>=0.25.2
```

Verification results:

- GuardianSim tests: 7/7 passed.
- Genesis GPU probe: passed for 20 steps.
- World and wrist frames: captured and visually inspected.
- Reference task: `011_banana -> 024_bowl`.
- Reference result: `success = True`.
- Reference frames: 8.

Commands:

```bash
/opt/venv/bin/python scripts/probe_genesis.py \
  --steps 20 \
  --save-frames \
  --output-dir outputs/evidence/genesis-probe

PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 /opt/venv/bin/python \
  franka_fruit_pick/grasp_demo.py \
  --pick 011_banana \
  --place 024_bowl \
  --save-frames
```

Durable evidence:

- [`evidence/session-a/README.md`](evidence/session-a/README.md)
- [`evidence/session-a/world.png`](evidence/session-a/world.png)
- [`evidence/session-a/wrist.png`](evidence/session-a/wrist.png)
- [`evidence/session-a/baseline-banana.gif`](evidence/session-a/baseline-banana.gif)
- Commit `64991a7` — `docs: add Radeon Cloud session A evidence`

Session exit:

- `scripts/end_gpu_session.sh` completed.
- GPU was idle at the final check.
- Code and critical evidence were copied off the instance and pushed.
- Final cloud-instance destruction remained pending explicit owner confirmation.

### Gate decision

Gate 1 is complete. Gate 2 must begin with local implementation of a concrete,
snapshot-safe Genesis rollout backend. No additional GPU session should be
launched until the five-candidate dry-run command and expected outputs are
defined and locally tested.
